# Portfolio Tracker

# Overview

An interactive data application for monitoring the performance of an individual’s financial portfolio.

The application provides a “holistic” portfolio view that contains cumulative metrics from all investment accounts (e.g. 401k, crypto, HSA, brokerage, etc) an individual may have.

Then each account can be analyzed in greater detail through an account specific data view.

Some of the questions that this application can help an individual answer:

1. What is my total portfolio value?  
2. What are my asset allocation percentages? (e.g. cash vs equities vs crypto, etc.)  
3. How risky (beta) is my overall portfolio?  
4. How is my portfolio performing compared to the S\&P500?
